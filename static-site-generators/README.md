## Static Site Generators
**Date**
**Time** (3 hours)
**Venue Details**

Have you heard of Jekyll, Gatsby, or Hugo? These are all examples of static site generators, a category of web development tool that’s quickly becoming the industry best practice for a variety of types of websites, from blogs, to marketing sites, to documentation.

Learning to use static site generators is a great way to level up your skills in HTML & CSS, and make your website creation more efficient.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll get an introduction to the static site generator landscape, and apply what you learn by building your own site in class.

We will cover:
• How static site generators work, and how they came to be
• Comparison of popular generators, with guidelines for choosing one for your next project
• Step-by-step creation and deployment of your own portfolio website using Eleventy, a popular new static site generator that’s great for beginners
• Brief overview of workflow and deployment options

PREREQUISITES

It’s helpful (but not entirely necessary) to have some experience with HTML and CSS. We’ll also be using the command line and a little bit of JavaScript, but you don’t need previous experience with these. Mostly, all you need is a willingness to learn and try new things!

TECH REQUIREMENTS

Please bring a laptop and charger so you can follow along with the exercises. The laptop should have the following installed:

• A text editor. I’ll be using VS Code, which is free and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
• A terminal. All computers have one by default, but if you’re using a Windows computer, please install Git (https://git-scm.com/download/win). We won’t be using Git, but the installer includes a terminal program that runs commands in the same way as I’ll be demonstrating.
• Node.js. You can download the installer at https://nodejs.org.

If you do not have a laptop, please contact the instructors. We have a limited number of Chromebooks for students to borrow.
